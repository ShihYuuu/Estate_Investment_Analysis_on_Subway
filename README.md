### The initial research questions you used to explore the data

Our client, a passionate fan of Subway sandwiches, is exploring the possibility of opening a franchise in a specific region of the United States. We plan to leverage data from SafeGraph to first identify which state or area has the highest Subway popularity, allowing our client to choose the ideal franchise location. Based on peak customer traffic in that region, our client will develop employee scheduling. Additionally, our client will tailor the menu offerings and promotional activities using demographic insights, such as age and income, from the state's population.


### Industry, geographic region, or metropolitan type of interest

When franchising Subway in the U.S., which region should be chosen, and how can the most efficient employee schedule be created? Additionally, how should the menu and promotional items be designed based on demographic data?

## Question to achieve goal
1. Which state has the highest average annual visits to Subway and is more competitive compared to other competitors?
2. What's the percentage of people in Puerto Rico that have an annual income of less than $15,000, what's the percentage of male and female children in Puerto Rico? And compare the result to the other regions in the U.S.
3. Given the decision to focus on the poor market, which county in Puerto Rico has the highest proportion of poor people?
4. On which days of the week does the Subway restaurant in Puerto Rico have a higher average number of visits?

## Summary
Based on the research findings, we discovered that Subway locations in Puerto Rico not only have the highest average number of visits, but also the highest proportion of Subway stores among all limited-service restaurants in various regions of the U.S. Furthermore, Puerto Rico has the highest poverty rate (with an average annual income below $15,000) among all U.S. regions, with Guánica Municipio County being the area with the highest rate.

We recommend that our client open a Subway franchise in Guánica Municipio County, Puerto Rico, targeting lower-income groups with affordable meal deals. Additionally, based on the daily and weekly visitation patterns, we suggest that franchise owners increase staff scheduling on Tuesdays and Fridays to accommodate higher traffic on these days.
